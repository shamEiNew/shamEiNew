## 🧮 The Mathematical Journey

**Background:** Post-graduate in Mathematics  
**Current Mission:** Building analytics intelligence systems  
**Philosophy:** Self-taught, curiosity-driven, forever learning

I specialize in bridging the gap between theoretical mathematics and real-world applications, using computational methods and ML to crack complex problems that exist at the intersection of:
- 🔢 Pure mathematical challenges
- 📊 Domain-specific analytical problems

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

### Languages
- **Python** – my goto language
- **Coq/Rocq** – Learning
- **Lean4** - Learning

### Libraries in My Arsenal
- **NumPy** & **Pandas** – Data manipulation wizardry
- **Scikit-learn** – Classical ML that still works wonders
- **TensorFlow** & **PyTorch** – Deep learning dual-wielding
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Making data beautiful
- **PyTorch**

### Frontend Technologies
- **React** – somewhat
- **HTML/CSS** – classics

## 🔬 Current Research Interests

I'm currently deep in the mathematical trenches exploring:

- **Category Theory and Software foundations**  
  *Understanding how symbolic AI can be built*

-  **Algorithmic Techniques in Group Theory**  
  *Uncovering computational patterns in algebraic structures*

- 🧠 **Deep Neural Network Architectures**  
  *Understanding what makes networks tick (and converge)*

The intersection of these fields fascinates me—there's something beautiful about applying group-theoretic symmetries to neural network design.

## 🌱 The Self-Taught Path

Most of what I know came from late-night documentation deep-dives, countless Stack Overflow tabs, and the occasional "aha!" moment at 3 AM. I believe the best way to learn is to build, break, and rebuild.

**My learning philosophy:**
- 📚 Read the papers
- 💻 Implement the concepts
- 🐛 Debug until it works
- 🔄 Repeat

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!

I'm always excited to work on interesting problems, especially those involving:
- Symbolic AI and computation
- Mathematical modeling and optimization
- Machine learning applications
- Computational methods for complex systems
- Analytics and data intelligence

**Got a challenging project?** I'm happy to learn, contribute, and help bring mathematical elegance to your codebase.
