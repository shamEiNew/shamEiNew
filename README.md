## 🛠️ My Toolkit

### Languages
- **Python** – my goto language
- **Coq/Rocq** – Learning
- **Lean4** - Learning

### Libraries in My Arsenal
- **NumPy** & **Pandas** 
- **Scikit-learn** 
- **TensorFlow** & **PyTorch** 
- **PyTorch**

## 🔬 Current Research Interests

I'm currently deep in the mathematical trenches exploring:

- **Category Theory and Software foundations**  
  *Understanding how super intelligent systems can be built with foundations in Type theory*

-  **Algorithmic Techniques in Group Theory**  
  *Uncovering computational patterns in algebraic structures*

- 🧠 **Deep Neural Network Architectures**  
  *Understanding what makes networks tick (and converge)*

## 🌱 The Self-Taught Path

Most of what I know came from late-night documentation deep-dives, countless Stack Overflow tabs.

**My learning philosophy:**
- 📚 Read, Do, Read, Do, Fail, Read, Do

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate!

I'm always excited to work on interesting problems, especially those involving:
- Automated Theorem Proving
- Superintelligent Systems
- Machine learning applications
- Computational methods for complex systems
- Analytics and data intelligence

**Got a challenging project?** I'm happy to learn, contribute, and help bring mathematical elegance to your codebase.
